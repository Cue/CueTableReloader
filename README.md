CueTableReloader
================

A really handy class that automatically figures out insertions, deletions, and reloads in UITableView based on unique item keys.

### Notice
This is still in the early stages of development, as such it does not yet have extensive testing. It may not yet work at all for multi-section table views. In addition, it does not currently recognize order-swapping as anything other than deletion/reinsertions

Much of this will be remedied tomorrow during [Back On The Map](https://objectivechackathon.appspot.com)
